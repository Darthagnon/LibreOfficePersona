# LibreOffice Personas
A collection of LibreOffice Personas in the Microsoft Office 2016 style

## Usage
Replace default (rubbish) Personas included with LibreOffice @
```C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\share\gallery\personas\```

## Known bugs
- These custom personas will be replaced with the defaults every time you update LibreOffice
- **Because LibreOffice does not support custom themes properly** (I have opened multiple bug reports, see [Readme.txt](Readme.txt):
	- You will need to rename the files from this repository according to the theme files already present.
	- You cannot use all the included custom themes simultaneously.
	- You must destructively replace the original themes.
	- The same theme will apply across all of LibreOffice (e.g. you can't separately colour LibreCalc "Excel-green" and LibreWriter "Word-blue")

### HOW TO INSTALL

For LibreOffice 6 and above, download and install the theme as an extension : [https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArgKmgFcmBYHhSQkPfyMZRnXX5LJ](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArgKmgFcmBYHhSQkPfyMZRnXX5LJ) with `Tools` > `Extension manager`.

The theme packaged as an extension is the easiest way to install (no admin rights needed), only in LibreOffice 6 and above.

Previous versions of LibreOffice don't allow themes as extension, you have to follow those steps :

1. Download (button at top right of this page) and rename zip file to images_office2013.zip and copy it to this folder:
	- Windows:  `C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 5\share\config\`
    - Linux:  `/usr/lib/libreoffice/share/config/` and `/usr/share/libreoffice/share/config/` or `/opt/libreoffice<version>/share/config/` (use a symlink)
    - OS X:  `LibreOffice/Contents/Resources/config/`

 2. Open LibreOffice, go to `Tools` > `Options` > `LibreOffice` > `View` and change the icon style to Office2013.

 3. Restart LibreOffice.
